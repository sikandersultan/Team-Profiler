## Description 

As a very very busy CEO of a massive unnamed company, I have no time to make up a webpage for all my employees and their relevant credentials. Oh how I wish there was a simple (relatively simple anyway) to quickly enter all their information and create a polished site.

## Usage

This team profile builder can be initiated in the command line of your choosing software. I used git bash and its pretty good. Once started it will ask you all the relevant questions it needs for the webpage and go off to create an html site to access. It is not a perfect solution but it is a good starting point.

This application also has test suites. To run them, run the command `npm run test` in the command line.

## Installation

Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies for this application. Then run `node index.js` in the folder where that file is saved. It will start asking about what employees you would like to add. If you need further help, below is a video link to help you.
